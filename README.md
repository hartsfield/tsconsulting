# static_server

This project is a static server written in Go. It's useful as a starting 
template for building web applications. It's built using the Compose 
Development Pattern. To run this code, simply clone the git repository, 
cd into the root directory, and run:

    go run .

This should spin up a server on port 8080. When you navigate to 
`localhost:8080`, you should see the words "title", and "hello world".
