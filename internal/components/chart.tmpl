                  Our pre-consultation is a short FREE consultation, where we 
                  can get a basic idea of your project and decide what 
                  direction we're able to take it in. If it sounds like 
                  something we can work with, we can move to the next step of 
                  the process and discuss your project in-depth.

          <div class="itemDescription">
                  During our full consultation, we'll ask in-depth questions 
                  about your project, including technical and design questions,
                  and we'll discuss the different methods for developing your
                  project. When you leave this consultation, you'll have 
                  deep knowledge on multiple ways to implement your project, 
                  and you can then choose to let us create a full development 
                  plan for your project, or take your idea to another firm.

          <div class="itemDescription">
                  Product planning & design is the process of planning and 
                  designing your project. This could be done in days, weeks, or
                  months, and during this time, we'll stay in close contact or 
                  work directly with you and/or your company, to find out all 
                  the details needed to complete your project. At the end, 
                  you'll be presented with a professional copy of a technical 
                  manual that we can then use to create your project, or you 
                  can choose to take this manual to another firm, or hire 
                  your own team of programmers, and perhaps negotiate a cheaper 
                  rate.

                  During this phase, TSConsulting will develop your project, 
                  and deploy it on whatever infrastucture we previously 
                  discussed. Some projects are only a few lines of code, while 
                  others could amount to hundreds of thousands or more. 
                  A price will be determined based on the technical complexity 
                  of your project. At the end of this phase, you will own a 
                  complete and production-ready version of your project, 
                  deployed on your chosen infrastructure.
